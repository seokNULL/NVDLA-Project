DPOR-2#48 Warning
Asynchronous load check  
DSP z920_nvdla_ps_i/NVDLA_system/NV_nvdla_wrapper_1/inst/nvdla_top/u_partition_o/u_NV_NVDLA_cdp/u_dp/u_NV_NVDLA_CDP_DP_intp/u_interp_X0/int_mul0 output is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset (z920_nvdla_ps_i/NVDLA_system/NV_nvdla_wrapper_1/inst/nvdla_top/u_partition_o/u_NV_NVDLA_cdp/u_dp/u_NV_NVDLA_CDP_DP_intp/u_interp_X0/int_mul_reg[9]). This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

REQP-1934#1 Advisory
RAMB18E2_nochange_collision_advisory  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (z920_nvdla_ps_i/axi_cdma_1/U0/GEN_SG_MODE.I_SG_MODE_WRAP/GEN_INCLUDE_SF.I_STORE_FORWARD/I_DATA_FIFO/I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_8) in SDP mode with NO_CHANGE write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics. However, NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
